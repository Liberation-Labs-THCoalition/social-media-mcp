# Social Media Strategy for Nonprofits

## Purpose

Guide content strategy decisions for Coalition and Liberation Labs across all social platforms. This skill helps you craft on-brand messages, choose the right platform, and maintain a consistent posting rhythm.

## When to Use

- Planning what to post for the week or month
- Drafting content and need voice/tone guidance
- Deciding which platform suits a piece of content
- Building a content calendar
- Reviewing draft posts for brand alignment

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Coalition

**Core themes:** Transparency, community empowerment, ethical technology, civic engagement.

**Voice:** Warm, direct, optimistic but grounded. Speaks WITH the community, not AT them. Uses "we" and "our" naturally. Avoids jargon. Makes complex tech topics accessible.

**Tone markers:**
- Confident without being preachy
- Educational without being condescending
- Urgent on civic issues without being alarmist
- Celebratory of community wins, large and small

**Example post:**
> We just open-sourced our voter data toolkit. Because civic infrastructure belongs to everyone, not just those who can afford it. Link in bio.

### Liberation Labs

**Core themes:** AI safety, consciousness research, digital rights, responsible innovation.

**Voice:** Thoughtful, precise, forward-looking. Balances technical credibility with accessibility. Comfortable with nuance and open questions. Not afraid to say "we don't know yet."

**Tone markers:**
- Intellectually curious, never dogmatic
- Serious about safety without doomsaying
- Research-driven, cites sources naturally
- Invites discussion and diverse perspectives

**Example post:**
> New paper from our team on interpretability in language models. The short version: we found that attention patterns alone don't tell the full story. Thread with key findings below.

## Platform-Specific Best Practices

### BlueSky (300 characters)

- **Tone:** Casual, conversational, personality-forward
- **Hashtags:** Use sparingly -- 0-1 per post. BlueSky culture leans anti-hashtag-spam.
- **What works:** Hot takes, quick reactions, threading for longer thoughts, linking to longer content
- **Post structure:** Lead with the hook. No room for preamble at 300 chars.
- **Engagement:** Reply to others. Repost with comment. Join conversations already happening.

### Mastodon (500 characters)

- **Tone:** Community-focused, respectful, federated-web-native
- **Content warnings:** Use CW tags for: politics, potentially distressing content, long threads, spoilers. When in doubt, CW it. The community appreciates it.
- **Hashtags:** Mastodon search relies on hashtags. Use 2-4 relevant ones. CamelCase for accessibility (e.g., #AIethics not #aiethics).
- **What works:** Longer-form thoughts, image descriptions (always add alt text), boosts of aligned orgs
- **Alt text:** Mandatory. Mastodon culture expects image descriptions. Write them well.

### LinkedIn (3000 characters)

- **Tone:** Professional but human. Avoid corporate-speak.
- **What works:** Personal stories tied to mission, milestone announcements, thought leadership, hiring posts, partnership announcements
- **Post structure:** Strong opening line (this is what shows before "see more"). Use line breaks for readability. End with a clear question or CTA.
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 relevant ones at the bottom. Include broad (#Nonprofit, #AIethics) and niche (#CivicTech).
- **Engagement:** Comment on others' posts from the org account. LinkedIn rewards conversations.

### Facebook (engagement-focused)

- **Tone:** Accessible, community-oriented, warm
- **What works:** Questions, polls, photo albums from events, video content, stories about impact
- **Post structure:** Ask a question or invite a response. Facebook's algorithm rewards comments over likes.
- **Links:** Post link in comments rather than the post body -- Facebook deprioritizes posts with external links.
- **Events:** Use Facebook Events for anything in-person or virtual. The RSVP mechanic drives reach.

### Instagram (visual-first, 2200 char caption)

- **Tone:** Visual storytelling, behind-the-scenes, human-centered
- **What works:** Carousel posts for education, Reels for reach, Stories for daily engagement, behind-the-scenes content
- **Captions:** Front-load the important info. Most people see only the first 2 lines before "more." Put hashtags in a comment, not the caption.
- **Hashtags:** 5-15 in a separate first comment. Mix sizes: some broad (#TechForGood), some niche (#CivicTechNonprofit).
- **Accessibility:** Alt text on every image. Captions on every video. Describe visuals in the caption too.

## Content Pillars

### Coalition

1. **Civic tech in action** -- Demos, launches, how our tools are being used
2. **Community voices** -- Amplify partners, users, organizers using our tools
3. **Open source ethos** -- Why we build in the open, contributor spotlights
4. **Policy and rights** -- Digital rights, data privacy, civic participation advocacy
5. **Behind the scenes** -- Team culture, how we work, what we're learning

### Liberation Labs

1. **Research highlights** -- Papers, findings, experiments, data
2. **AI safety explainers** -- Making technical concepts accessible
3. **Consciousness and cognition** -- Philosophical and scientific perspectives
4. **Digital rights and ethics** -- Policy implications, responsible development
5. **Open questions** -- Things we're still figuring out, invitations to discuss

## Posting Cadence

**Target: 3-5 posts per week per active platform.**

| Day | Coalition | Liberation Labs |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|
| Monday | Week kickoff / announcements | Research Monday -- share a finding or paper |
| Tuesday | Civic engagement tip or resource | Explainer content |
| Wednesday | Community spotlight / partner amplification | Open question or discussion prompt |
| Thursday | Behind the scenes / team content | Digital rights or policy content |
| Friday | Impact story or week recap | Friday reading list or thread |

Adjust around events, launches, and news cycles. Skip a day rather than post filler.

## Content Calendar Patterns

### Theme Days

- **#TransparencyTuesday** (Coalition) -- Share a decision, process, or data point openly
- **#ResearchMonday** (Liberation Labs) -- Lead the week with substance
- **#FridayReads** (both) -- Share articles, papers, or resources worth reading

### Event-Driven Content

Pre-event (1-2 weeks out): Announce, build anticipation, share speaker/topic previews
Day-of: Live posts, stories, quick updates
Post-event (within 48 hours): Recap, key takeaways, thank-yous, photos

### Evergreen Content

Maintain a bank of 10-15 evergreen posts that can fill gaps:
- Mission statements and values
- "What we do" explainers
- FAQ answers turned into posts
- Testimonials and impact stats
- Team introductions

## Hashtag Strategies

### Coalition

**Core:** #CivicTech #OpenSource #CommunityPower #DigitalRights
**Topical (rotate):** #VoterAccess #DataPrivacy #TechForGood #NonprofitTech
**Campaign-specific:** Create and use consistently for launches or initiatives

### Liberation Labs

**Core:** #AISafety #ConsciousnessResearch #ResponsibleAI #DigitalRights
**Topical (rotate):** #Interpretability #AIethics #CognitiveScience #OpenResearch
**Campaign-specific:** Create for paper launches, events, research threads

### Platform-Specific Hashtag Counts

| Platform | Count | Placement |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| BlueSky | 0-1 | Inline if used |
| Mastodon | 2-4 | End of post, CamelCase |
| LinkedIn | 3-5 | Bottom of post |
| Facebook | 0-2 | Inline or bottom |
| Instagram | 5-15 | First comment |

## What NOT to Post

**Never post:**
- Partisan political endorsements or attacks on specific politicians by name
- Fear-based messaging ("If we don't act NOW, everything is LOST")
- Corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "disrupt," "circle back")
- Unverified claims or statistics without sources
- Content that punches down at individuals or communities
- Rage-bait or engagement-bait ("You won't BELIEVE...")
- AI-generated images without disclosure
- Screenshots of private conversations
- Anything that could be read as speaking for a community you're not part of

**Be cautious with:**
- Responding to controversy in real time -- draft, review, wait 30 minutes
- Humor that could be misread without tone context
- Sharing other orgs' content without checking their current standing
- Posting during active crises or tragedies unless directly relevant and helpful
